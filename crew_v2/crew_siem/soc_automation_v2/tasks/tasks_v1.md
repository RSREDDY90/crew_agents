Excellent — this is a really good SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) use-case implementation using CrewAI tasks 🧠

Let’s break it down step-by-step, mapping each function and CrewAI concept to how it works in a real SOC (Security Operations Center) context.

⸻

🔍 Overview: What This Script Does

This script defines four SOC tasks for your CrewAI-powered SIEM automation pipeline:
	1.	Detect suspicious brute-force attempts
	2.	Correlate failed attempts with successful logins
	3.	Trigger automated response (alerting, blocking, etc.)
	4.	Generate a human-readable incident report

Each task is a Task in CrewAI — meaning it’s performed by a specific Agent (like Investigator, Correlator, Responder, Reporter), and each task produces an expected output.

⸻

⚙️ CrewAI Concept Refresher
	•	Agent → a role that performs a specialized job (e.g., Analyst, Responder).
	•	Task → a unit of work with clear input, description, and expected output.
	•	Crew → a collection of Agents + Tasks executing in order.

So your pipeline is like a SOC “assembly line” — one agent’s output becomes another’s input.

🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation of Each Task

🕵️‍♂️ 1️⃣ analyze_failed_logins

Agent: investigator

Goal: Detect brute-force attempts — too many failed logins in a short time.

🔧 Function: analyze_failed_logins_action
	•	Logic:
	1.	Look back over the last 10 minutes (window_minutes).
	2.	Find all IPs with ≥ 5 failed logins (threshold = 5).
	3.	Query the ClickHouse table siem_login_events.
	4.	Group by ip and tenant_id.
	5.	Collect stats:
	•	failed_count
	•	first_seen, last_seen
	•	Output:
A list of suspicious IPs that may be attempting brute-force attacks.

🧠 Expected Output:

“A list of IPs with their failed login counts and timestamps.”

🧾 Example Output:

[
  {
    "ip": "192.168.10.20",
    "tenant_id": "abc123",
    "failed_count": 7,
    "first_seen": "2025-10-18T20:00:00Z",
    "last_seen": "2025-10-18T20:05:00Z"
  }
]

🔗 2️⃣ correlate_successful_logins

Agent: correlator

Goal: Check if any of the failed IPs had a successful login soon after failing (a typical sign of compromised credentials).

🔧 Function: correlate_successful_logins_action
	•	For each suspicious IP:
	•	Query ClickHouse for a success event within 5 minutes after last_seen.
	•	If a success event exists → flag as a potential incident.
	•	Output:
List of incidents containing evidence of success-after-failure patterns.

🧠 Expected Output:

“A list of potential incidents where a successful login followed multiple failures.”

🧾 Example Output:

[
  {
    "ip": "192.168.10.20",
    "tenant_id": "abc123",
    "failed_count": 7,
    "evidence": [
      {
        "tenant_id": "abc123",
        "user_id": "user1",
        "ip": "192.168.10.20",
        "event_time": "2025-10-18T20:06:22Z",
        "event_type": "success"
      }
    ]
  }
]


⸻

🚨 3️⃣ incident_response_task

Agent: responder

Goal: Automatically send alerts for confirmed incidents.

🔧 Function: responder_action
	•	Builds a payload containing:
	•	IP, tenant_id, failed_count
	•	Evidence (from previous step)
	•	Suggested actions (block IP, reset password, notify owner)
	•	Sends this payload via send_incident_alert() (a REST POST).
	•	Output:
List of REST API responses from alert system.

🧠 Expected Output:

“A list of alert responses confirming that incident notifications were sent.”

🧾 Example Output:

[
  {
    "payload": {
      "title": "Potential account compromise - brute force followed by success",
      "ip": "192.168.10.20",
      "tenant_id": "abc123",
      "failed_count": 7,
      "evidence": [...],
      "suggested_action": ["block_ip", "force_password_reset", "notify_owner"]
    },
    "response": {"status": "ok", "alert_id": "INC-5678"}
  }
]

📄 4️⃣ generate_report_task

Agent: reporter

Goal: Summarize all detected incidents in a human-readable markdown report.

🔧 Function: reporter_action
	•	Iterates through the detected incidents and alert responses.
	•	Builds a Markdown report with:
	•	Incident number
	•	IP and tenant
	•	Failed attempts
	•	Evidence details
	•	Response results
	•	Output:
Markdown text — perfect for sending to Slack, email, or dashboard.

🧠 Expected Output:

“A markdown report summarizing detected incidents, evidence, and response status.”

🧾 Example Output (Markdown):

# SIEM Incident Report

## Incident 1: IP 192.168.10.20
- Tenant: abc123
- Failed attempts: 7
- Evidence:
  - 2025-10-18T20:06:22Z user=user1 event=success
- Alert API response: {'status': 'ok', 'alert_id': 'INC-5678'}

🔄 End-to-End Flow Summary

Step	Agent	Task	Input	Output
1	Investigator	AnalyzeFailedLogins	SIEM logs	Suspicious IP list
2	Correlator	CorrelateSuccess	Failed IP list	Confirmed incidents
3	Responder	IncidentResponder	Incidents	Alert confirmations
4	Reporter	GenerateReport	Incidents + alerts	Markdown summary


⸻

🧠 Why This Matters

This design mirrors a real-world SOC automation pipeline:
	•	Detect → Correlate → Respond → Report
	•	Easily extensible (add new agents like “Threat Enricher” or “GeoIP Validator”)
	•	Supports real backends (ClickHouse for event data, REST API for alerts)

or
✅ the tools/ folder implementations (for clickhouse_tool and alert_tool) so you can run this end-to-end?
